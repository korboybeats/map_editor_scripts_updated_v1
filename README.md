# mostlyfireproof's Map Editor Scripts Updated V1

### Getting started:
1. Download this repo and replace your current scripts (back them up first if you have changed anything you want to keep).
2. Launch game in dev mode.
3. Enter this command in console:

`bind X "loadouts_devset character_selection character_bloodhound; give mp_weapon_editor; "; bind V "+offhand1" bind T "ToggleThirdPerson"; bind F "noclip"; bind E "+pushtotalk"; bind Q "+use"; bind "3" "+scriptCommand6"; bind "4" "+scriptCommand1"; bind "5" "weapon_inspect"; bind "6" "+offhand3"`

### Keybinds:
* `X` Switch your character to Bloodhound and give you the prop tool.
* `V` Equip the prop tool.
* `T` Change perspective mode.
* `F` Toggle noclip.
* `MOUSE1` Place prop.
* `E` Cycle to next prop.
* `Q` Cycle to previous prop.
* `1` Raise prop.
* `2` Lower prop.
* `3` Change Roll (x).
* `4` Change Pitch (y).
* `5` Change Yaw (z).
* `6` Change snap size.
* `Z` Open the model menu.
