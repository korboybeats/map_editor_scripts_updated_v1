Enter this command in console:

bind X "loadouts_devset character_selection character_bloodhound; give mp_weapon_editor; "; bind T "ToggleThirdPerson"; bind F "noclip"; bind E "+pushtotalk"; bind Q "+use"; bind "3" "+scriptCommand6"; bind "4" "+scriptCommand1"; bind "5" "weapon_inspect"; bind "6" "+offhand3"

Pressing X will switch your character to Bloodhound and equip the prop tool.
Pressing T will change perspective mode.
Pressing F will toggle noclip.




This command is to bind F5 to refresh a map after making a change (replace 'mapname' with the actual map's name):

bind "F5" "changelevel mapname"

For example: bind "F5" "changelevel mp_rr_desertlands_64k_x_64k"

You can also bind other keys to other map names as well.
